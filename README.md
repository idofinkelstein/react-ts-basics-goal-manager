# React + TypeScript + Vite - Goal Tracker App

This project is a simple, interactive web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows users to add their goals with a description and a short summary, which are then displayed in a list on the page. This project was created as a first experience with React and TypeScript.

## Features

*   **Add New Goals:** Users can input their goals and a short description using a form.
*   **Display Goal List:** The added goals are displayed in a list format on the page.
*   **Interactive:** The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing goals.

## Technologies Used

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
*   **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and efficient development experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL provided by Vite).**

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```
```

I have updated the `README.md` file to include a description of your project, its features, the technologies used, and instructions on how to get started. Let me know if you'd like me to make any further changes!
